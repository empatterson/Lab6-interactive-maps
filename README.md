# Interactive Maps
This code creates several interactive map outputs looking at the number of Starbucks shops in LA county, California. The code uses a few libraries inluding Pandas and Folium which 
uses a javascrip library called Leaflet to build two interactive web maps. One map shows the number of Starbucks per zip code and the other map shows GPS locations of each 
Starbucks location in the county. There is a third output map that uses Folium data to create a map of 2012 unemployment rates for each state. 

### Summary

This map was useful in practicing cartography and examples of ways that data can be modified to produce a desired output. For instance, if someone was unaware of how Zip codes are 
designed they may view the first choropleth map (showing points within a boundary) and see that downtown LA has the highest density of Starbucks but other outlying regions of LA 
county are in fact larger (spreading out the density) and are uninhabited. This makes the analysis useless and creates a false narrative about the density. While looking at 
Starbucks locations can seem trivial, the idea represents a larger concept of the power that users have to visually portray data and the implications that it can have.
